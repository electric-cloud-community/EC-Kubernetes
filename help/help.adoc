Plugin version @PLUGIN_VERSION@

Revised on September 17, 2020

== Plugin Configurations
Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply
across some or all of the plugin procedures. They
reduce repetition of common values, create
predefined parameter sets for end users, and
securely store credentials where needed. Each configuration
is given a unique name that is entered in designated
parameters on procedures that use them.


=== Creating Plugin Configurations
To create plugin configurations in {CD}, do these steps:

* Go to **Administration** &gt;**Plugins** to open the Plugin Manager.
* Find the EC-Kubernetes-@PLUGIN_VERSION@ row.
* Click *Configure* to open the
     Configurations page.
* Click *Create Configuration* as per the description of parameters below.


For communicating with the Kubernetes cluster, you need the following details:

. Base address of API Endpoint URL
. Bearer token which has authorization to access API.

Use the following steps for creating a service account and obtaining the service account bearer token:

** Download the Kubeconfig file from your Kubernetes cluster. Or if you have direct access to Kubectl shell of the cluster, that will work too.
** You will need to install Kubectl (http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/prereqs/) or have access to Kubectl shell
** Create a service account with following kubectl command:

----
kubectl create serviceaccount api-user
----

** Assign cluster-admin role to serviceaccount api-user. Specify serviceaccount name as default:api-user, if it is created in default namespace.

----
kubectl create clusterrolebinding root-cluster-admin-binding --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=default:api-user
----

** Get details of the service account we just created, from the output determine name of secret in which data is stored:

----
kubectl get serviceaccount api-user -o yaml
----

** Assuming name of secret from above step is secret-1234, get details of secret:

----
kubectl get secret secret-1234 -o yaml
----

** The value of the token field in the output above is base64 encoded. We need to decode it to use in the plugin configuration. On a Unix like system, following command can be used to decode the value:

----
echo "<encoded_token_value>" | base64 --decode
----

== Use Cases


[[RollingUpdates]]
=== Rolling Updates

Rolling updates or rolling deployment is a way to deploy a new version with zero downtime by incrementally updating instances running an old version with the new one. In Kubernetes, this is done using rolling updates which allows a _Deployment&#39;s_ update to take place by incrementally updating pods with new ones.

EC-Kubernetes plugin deploys services using rolling updates by default. When {CD} deploys a service to Kubernetes, the EC-Kubernetes plugin uses the following service attributes for the _Deployment_&#39;s rolling update attributes in Kubernetes.

. *Rolling Deployment - Min Microservice Instances:* Minimum number of pods that must be running during a rolling update. Defaults to 1 if not set.
. *Rolling Deployment - Max Microservice Instances:* Maximum number of pods that can be running during a rolling update. The incremental number of pods that can be created during the rolling update is the difference between this attribute and the *Number of microservice instances*.

[[CanaryDeployments]]
=== Canary Deployments

Canary deployment is a way of sending out a new release into production that plays the role of a &quot;canary&quot; to get an idea of how a new release will perform before rolling it out to all the users.

A canary deployment consists of rolling out a new release or a new functionality to a subset of users or servers. This can be achieved in a Kubernetes cluster by deploying a canary of a new release side by side with the previous release so that the new release can receive live production traffic before fully rolling it out. (Reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/#canary-deployments[Canary Deployments]).

When {CD} deploys a service to Kubernetes, the EC-Kubernetes plugin manages both the service in Kubernetes (the abstraction for a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them) as well as the deployment controller (a deployment controller provides declarative updates for pods and replicate sets). The service created or updated by the plugin is configured to point to the pods created based on the pod specifications declared in the deployment controller. In order to perform a canary deployment, the following two service mapping attributes can be set:

. *Perform Canary Deployment:* If true, then a canary deployment will be performed. Any previous deployment will remain unchanged in the namespace allowing this canary deployment to receive live traffic side by side with the previous deployment.
. *Number of Canary Replicas:* The number of replicas to create if performing a canary deployment. Defaults to 1 replica for the canary deployment.

Having these attributes in the service mapping allows you to use the same service deployment and undeployment processes that you would use for performing a more typical service deployment or undeployment. The following steps describe how this can be achieved.

. Set _\$[/myJob/canaryDeployment]_ as the property reference value for *Perform Canary Deployment* and _\$[/myJob/canaryReplicas]_ for *Number of Canary Replicas*.

image::cloudbees-common::cd-plugins/ec-kubernetes/canarydeploymentserviceattributes.png[image]

. Now add _canaryDeployment_ and _canaryReplicas_ as parameters to your service or application deploy and the undeploy processes.\
The values specified for these parameters will automatically be resolved when the service mapping is used by EC-Kubernetes while performing the deployment. If _canaryDeployment_ is set to true, then a canary deployment will be performed.\
image::cloudbees-common::cd-plugins/ec-kubernetes/canarydeploymentdeployprocessparameters.png[image]\
Similarly, during undeploy process through _Undeploy Service_ procedure, if _canaryDeployment_ is set to true, then the canary deployment will be removed without impacting the previous deployment or the service.
image::cloudbees-common::cd-plugins/ec-kubernetes/canarydeploymentundeployprocessparameters.png[screenshot]
. Finally tie the deploy and undeploy processes into an end-to-end service release pipeline including managing the canary deployments and rolling out new releases.
image::cloudbees-common::cd-plugins/ec-kubernetes/canarydeploymentpipeline.png[image]

** Define a &#39;deploy canary&#39; task to perform a canary deployment using the specified version on the same environment where the service is targeted.
** After the canary deployment is pushed out to the environment, side by side with the previous release, use a manual task to approve the roll out of the new version if it is confirmed that the &#39;canary deployment is safe&#39; and good to be rolled out.
** Once the canary deployment is confirmed to be safe and the pipeline is allowed to continue, define a &#39;deploy new service version&#39; task to deploy the new version of the service.
** Finally, regardless of the canary deployment&#39;s result, define an &#39;undeploy the canary&#39; task to undeploy the canary deployment.

[[BlueGreenDeployments]]
=== Blue/Green Deployments

Blue/green deployments allow us to deploy 2 versions of an application, the current version and the next to an environment and switch seamlessly between them with zero downtime for the application.

A blue/green deployment can be achieved in Kubernetes by creating a new deployment, say _my-deployment-green_ for running the new version while all the old pods created earlier for the older deployment, say _my-deployment-blue_ are still serving all the live requests. Once the new deployment has completed successfully, and has optionally been tested through a test service, then the service in Kubernetes is switched to send requests to the newly created pods running the new version.

When {CD} deploys a service to Kubernetes, the EC-Kubernetes plugin manages both the service in Kubernetes (the abstraction for a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them) as well as the deployment controller (a deployment controller provides declarative updates for pods and replicate sets). The service created or updated by the plugin is configured to point to the pods created based on the pod specifications declared in the deployment controller.
In order to orchestrate a blue/green deployment, the following two service mapping attributes can be leveraged:

. *Service Name Override:* Name for the service in Kubernetes. If no override value is specified, the service name in {CD} will be used to name the service in Kubernetes.
. *Deployment Name Override:* Name for the deployment in Kubernetes. If no value is specified, then the name of the Kubernetes service being created or updated will be used to name the deployment in Kubernetes.

\
Having these attributes in the service mapping allows you to use the same service deployment and undeployment processes that you would use for performing a more typical service deployment or undeployment. The following steps describe how a blue/green deployment can be orchestrated using the two service mapping attributes mentioned above.

. Set _\$[/myJob/serviceNameOverride]_ as the property reference value for *Service Name Override* and _\$[/myJob/deploymentNameOverride]_ for *Deployment Name Override*.

image::cloudbees-common::cd-plugins/ec-kubernetes/bluegreendeploymentserviceattributes.png[image]

. Now add _serviceNameOverride_ and _deploymentNameOverride_ as parameters to your service or application deploy and the undeploy processes.
The values specified for these parameters will automatically be resolved when the service mapping is used by EC-Kubernetes while performing the deployment. We will use different combination of values for these two parameters to do a blue/green deployment next.\

image::cloudbees-common::cd-plugins/ec-kubernetes/bluegreendeploymentdeployprocessparameters.png[image]

Similarly, we will use different combination of values for these two parameters when undeploying the service.

image::cloudbees-common::cd-plugins/ec-kubernetes/bluegreendeploymentundeployprocessparameters.png[image]

_Note that the processes also have a parameter defined for passing in the container image version to use when deploying the service._

. Now that the basic building blocks are in place, lets deploy the very first version of the service with no value set for _serviceNameOverride_ and _deploymentNameOverride_ set to say &#39;my-deployment-v1&#39;, where v1 is the image version number. This becomes the &#39;blue&#39; deployment or the version that is currently deployed. Now, for any new version that is to be deployed for the service, the deployment pipeline should include the following tasks in order to orchestrate a blue/green deployment:

image::cloudbees-common::cd-plugins/ec-kubernetes/bluegreendeploymentpipeline.png[image]

** Create an environment snapshot for the application or the microservice to capture deployment details for the service such as the current version deployed.
** Now define a task for the &#39;green&#39; deployment using the new version to create a deployment for. Use the service name override so that a new deployment is created in Kubernetes as well as a new service end-point. The new service end-point can be used to access the &#39;green&#39; deployment in order to perform any final tests or verification if required.
** Now, create another task for the deploy process, this time using the deployment name override but not the service name override. This will result in the original service&#39;s selector to be updated to target the pods created through the new deployment.
** Finally, define a &#39;cleanup blue deployment&#39; task to undeploy the original &#39;blue&#39; deployment as well as the new service end point by specifying both the service name override value and the deployment name override value.






== Known Issues
If microservices were previously deployed on Kubernetes v1.9 using the EC-Kubernetes v1.0.5 plugin and the plugin configuration was defined to use Kubernetes API version 1.9, then after upgrading to EC-Kubernetes 1.1.0 or above, the deployment fails with "HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity" error. As a work-around, the plugin configuration needs to be updated to use Kubernetes API version 1.7. After successfully redeploying all the microservices once, the plugin configuration can be switched back to Kubernetes API version 1.9.
